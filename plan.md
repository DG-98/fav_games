1. FIGURE OUT DB CONNECTIONS (cannot move forward without it) - done
2. write out associations in models - done 
3. Set up favorites with proper db associations - getting there
4. add/edit/delete comments 
5. styling (if there's time)


QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW 
1. find out how to add games to join table (maybe makeshift solution with "sync" button that adds to join table and renders??)
2. link to view favorites 
3. comments post/edit/delete
